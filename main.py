# Instructions:

# 1. Run: "TestSVM.py".
#    Results:
#               - Data Sets & Data Labels will be generated.
#               - SVM training will occur.
#               - Cross Validation data will be generated.
#               - Cross Validation data prediction will occur.
#               - The training and Cross Validation results will be shown on a window.

# 2. Close the window to proceed to the next test.
#    Results:
#               - Noisy data will be generated.
#               - Noisy data prediction will occur.
#               - The training and data results will be shown on a window.

# 3. Close the window to proceed to the next test.
#    Results:
#               - Bigger noise data will be generated.
#               - Bigger noise data prediction will occur.
#               - The training and data results will be shown on a window.
